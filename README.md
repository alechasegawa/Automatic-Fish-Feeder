# Automatic-Fish-Feeder
Automatic Fish Feeder Files for Lopez Elementary

These files should only be downloaded and used per instructions outlined in the Automatic Fish Feeder user manual.
The Automatic_Fish_Feeder.ino contains the critical Arduino code to operate the fish feeder. This code can be edited and viewed through the Arduino IDE. The StepperDriver-master folder contains libraries used to function the motor hardware. If you are editing or reuploading the fish feeder code, then these stepper driver files are necessary.
